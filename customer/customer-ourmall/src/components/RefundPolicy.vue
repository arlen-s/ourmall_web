        <h2 id="causes-refund">2. Causes for a Refund</h2>
        <p>
          As an owner, distributor, and controller, {{$root.$children[0].pName.a}} may provide
          full or partial product and service refunds under exceptional
          circumstances. The reasons that make us honor customer refund requests
          are as follows.
        </p>
        <h3>2.1. Product Refunds</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Non-delivery of the product</strong>. Due to the email
            provider's mailing issues, users' mail server errors, or spam
            settings, they might not receive our delivery emails. In this case,
            we recommend contacting us for assistance. Users must send written
            claims for non-delivery to our Billing Department at <a href="javascript:;">suppor<i class="fa fa-at" aria-hidden="true"></i>ourmall.com</a>
            within 14 (fourteen) days from the order date. Otherwise, we
            consider the product received and downloaded.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Major defects</strong>. Although our review team thoroughly
            examines all products before publishing them on the market,
            unexpected errors* may occur. Users should report such issues as
            bugs, critical errors, and functionality defects directly to product
            authors via submitting a ticket in their user account. The author has to rectify the error** or defect within 3 (three)
            business days. Suppose a defect is verified and the product author
            fails to fix it within 3 (three) business days from the date of the
            initial complaint email. In that case, a market holds the right
            to issue a full refund*** without any compensations or
            reimbursements.
          </li>

            resolution of the case. Refusal to provide a sufficient level of
            access for troubleshooting and resolving an issue may lead to refund
            request refusal.</i

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Product not-as-described</strong>. Users should report such
            issues directly to the product author within 14 (fourteen) days from
            the purchase date. Users must provide clear evidence proving that
            the purchased item does not coincide with its product description
            page. We do not honor complaints that merely base on the customer’s
            false expectations or wishes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>2.2. Service Refunds</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Service not rendered</strong>. Buyers can request the
            service cancellation before the actual work on the project starts.
            Users should submit such requests within 3 (three) months from the
            purchase date.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Delayed service delivery</strong>. Users can request a
            refund if the service provider (author, partner,Service Center) can not deliver it within a specified time frame due to
            unexpected issues on the service provider’s side*. Note that the
            project starts after the buyer provides all the information required
            for the service delivery (access credentials, project
            specifications, etc.) Failure to supply such information on time may
            result in declining the refund request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Service not-as-described. Users should submit</strong> such
            requests within 14 (fourteen) days from the project completion date.
            Users must provide clear evidence proving that the delivered service
            does not match its description.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <i
            >*In complex projects consisting of several milestones,
            <strong
              >we can issue a partial refund covering the cost of the service's
              milestones that have not been completed</strong
            >. Please mind that service purchases over 3 (three) months are not
            eligible for a refund.</i

          **The market $1 handling fee for product and service delivery is
          not subject to refund or exchange without exceptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          ***The extended support service
          is not subject to refund.
        </p>
          <p>****The order service fee is refundable if all of these criteria are met:
          <ul>
            <li>The order quantity of recharge is not used.</li>

        <h2 id="request-refund">3. How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <p>
          Users should give it up to 24 business hours for an author to handle
          the issue before submitting a refund request.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the author cannot resolve it, users should send a request to the
          market representatives. {{$root.$children[0].pName.a}} Billing Department
          examines the claim within 2 (two) weeks after receiving a customer
          request. Users should supplement the initial claim with detailed and
          grounded reasons why they apply for a refund referring to this Refund
          Policy. Before creating a refund request, users should make sure that
          it coincides with our
          Terms and Conditions.
